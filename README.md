# BudgetTracker
Creating a expense tracker that it based off the 50/30/20 rule. This is built to help me and others keep tracker of their own expenses for the month. 

Goals:
- Allow a user to login in
- Users can see the dashboard that will contain last month expenses and current months expenses
- Users will be able to manually enter their expenses
- Users will be able to enter their after-tax income to automatically see the breakdown of amount that goes for the 50/30/20 rule

Stretch Goals:
- Highlight excessive spending
- Provide a fitting range to the individuals goals
- Allow for upcoming expenses and analyze remaining balance (concerts, traveol expenses, etc)
